# bikesharing

## Overview of the project
 To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

## Results:

1. Most of the trips last less than 30 minutes
2. 65% of the users are men while just 25% are women. We most focus our efforts in men (we donÂ´t know the gender of 10%)
3. The minutes of usage is very similar in men and women.
4. There are different patterns of usage in weekdays and weekends. While we have rush hours in weekdays in the morning and in the evening, the rush hours in weekends are at noon.
5. The trips by weekday are very similar betwen men and women.
6. The core business are suscribers (above 80%)
7. The most important segment are men suscribers
